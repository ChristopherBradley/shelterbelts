# -

# Load worldcover


# Load the global canopy height


# Align global canopy height to worldcover


# Cluster shelterbelts


# Select shelterbelts larger than a given size


# Load wind data


# Decide on dominant wind direction


# Assign each pasture pixel a distance from shelterbelt in the prevailing wind direction


# Save these distances as a tif file
